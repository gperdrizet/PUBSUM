# Parallel Summarization Benchmark TODO

1. Get/set system CPU/GPU count automatically
2. ~~Add GPU/CPU count and abstracts per job to results~~
3. ~~Should we be doing replicates or collecting individual job run times?~~ Added replicates.
4. ~~Add summarization rate (abstracts/sec.) to data collection.~~
5. Clear GPU memory & delete models after runs.
